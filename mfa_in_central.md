## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in Central

Setting up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your accounts in Central.

To configure the MFA:

1. Log in to the [Central portal](https://central.portal.com).
2. On the `User Management` pane, click `Account Settings`.
3. Select `Add MFA`.
4. Select the user account and choose the `Assign MFA Device` option.
5. Select the desired authenticator device from the list.
6. Determine whether the MFA app supports QR codes, and then do one of the following:
    * From the wizard, choose Show QR code, and then use the app to scan the QR code.
      
      For example, you might choose the camera icon or choose an option similar to scan the QR code, and then use the device's camera to scan the code.
    * From the wizard, choose `Show Secret Key`, and then type the secret key into your MFA app.

    Once the configuration is complete, the authenticator device starts generating one-time passwords.

The MFA has been configured successfully.
