The following are the permissions that you can set for a user or a user group in Central:

* Create: Users with create permissions can add new data or records to the system. For example, they can create new user profiles or input new information into the Central application.

* Edit: Users with edit permissions can modify existing data or records. They can update user profiles, edit information, and make changes to data as needed.
